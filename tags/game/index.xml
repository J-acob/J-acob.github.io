This is a pre-pre-alpha demo version of a game I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on as a way to learn Rust on a more intricate level. The gameplay is very barebones right now. A single level with some enemies, once you kill them all - you win.</description>

      <description>Heyo. This is my first blog entry ever. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what to write about here. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of potential topics I want to cover here relating to my career and hobbies. I&amp;rsquo;m planning on figuring out how to load webassembly and have some interesting content/games load onto this website. For now, I need to figure out how hugo really works for building websites.
There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of integrations that are available for the theme I&amp;rsquo;m using for this site that I want to explore (such as comments for posts).</description>
